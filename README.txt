Calculate Total Price Upon Quantity Increment at WooCommerce Single Product Page

== Description ==

From a UX point of view, ecommerce customers may enjoy a little improvement on the WooCommerce single product page. As soon as they increase the add to cart quantity, it’d be nice if product price could be recalculated or maybe if a “TOTAL” line could appear so that users always know how much they are about to add to cart.
